# Recurse Center Learnings

I was challenged by a mentor @flafeer to keep a log of what I have learned and what questions I have throughout my time at the Recurse Center. I think it is a brilliant idea so here we are! I would love it if you commented on anything that I am learning (particularly if you have answers to my questions!) - the easiest way would be to comment on the daily commit. I'll keep everything to one commit per day! So feel free to browse around or start watching the repo for what should be ~5x a week notifications. I expect this to go on for about 50 days or so, depending on if this is fun or tedious haha.

As a heads up, I expect to be looking at things like algorithms, math, golang, machine learning, concurrency, cryptocurrency, random fun hacks and who knows what else might spring up! But that might give you an idea of what I'm looking at. :)

If you have any questions about what RC is - please ask me about it!
