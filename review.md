# Recurse Review

## What does it mean to have a continuously learning Software Engineering culture?

* seems to be at the forefront of every engineering manager and leader across the country
* engineers and managers trained in the core principles of engineering
* feeling confident that as technology changes, they can adapt too

## What makes the Recurse Center work so well?

* social rules
* believing that it takes time and discipline to truly excel in this field
* bring together a diverse group of engineers (vs all the same skill level working together)
* freedom to work as you desire (and expectation that you can handle this)

## Why is it so important?

* fear & impostor syndrome (add stat(s) here)
* engineers statically want to switch every 2-3 years (research here)
* Instead of having them leave companies, could this turnover be avoided by having a planned form of a break for them?

## Could you level up an entire engineering organization with these principles?

* network effects (stat here)
* creating comfort in change (research here - from HBR?)

## (Sure, having a 3 month engineering writer’s retreat for everyone would be wonderful, but) Are there things we could do now?

* AKA how can you create this culture in everyday engineering?
* Research any benefits for each one!
    * Code Dojos
    * Paper Reading
    * Video Watching over lunch
    * Pair with directors
    * Code Retreat
    * Lunch & Learns (already have)
    * Flow-State Culture
    * Book Readings

## But what if a company really wants to innovate in this area?

* soft proposal for an internal recurse center
* can I put together an estimate for actual engineering cost if the expectation was to do this ever 2.5 years
    * subtract loss of employee / recruiting cost
* there wouldn’t be an expectation that every engineer would want or like to do this - just as an opportunity for those that do!
